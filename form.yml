description: |
  This app will launch a COMSOL Multiphysics GUI on one or more Oakley nodes.
  You will be able to interact with the COMSOL GUI through a VNC session.

      - **any** - (*12 cores*) Chooses anyone of the available Oakley nodes.
        This reduces the wait time as you have no requirements.
      - **vis** - (*12 cores*) This node includes an NVIDIA Tesla M2070 GPU
        with an X server running in the background. This allows for Hardware
        Rendering with the GPU typically needed for 3D visualization using
        VirtualGL. There are currently only 128 of these nodes on Oakley.
      - **bigmem** - (*12 cores*) This Oakley node comes with 192GB of
        available RAM. There are only 8 of these nodes on Oakley.
      - **hugemem** - (*32 cores*) This Oakley node has 1TB of available RAM as
        well as 32 cores. There is only 1 of these nodes on Oakley. A
        reservation may be required to use this node.
